# MAST-program
C++ program that solves the problem know in IT as Maximum agreement subtree problem (MAST).

## Explanation of the problem

MAST-program consists in the implementation of an algorithm that reads a set of n rooted trees in the NEWICK format, and then for each of n(n-1)/2 pairs of trees calculates the minimum number of leaves whose removal from both trees will make them isomorphic. 
Here are two examples of trees, each containing 10 identical leaves labeled from 1 to 10:
